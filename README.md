# Applied_Data_Science_2017

#### Homework and Project repository for ADS 2017

#### Description
This course introduces students to the __theory, principles and applications of mathematical and computer modeling__ of data as applied to cities. It will be based on two unified themes: foundations for __predictive analytics__ and __decision-making__ followed by applications in data science. The 1st half of the course will cover predictive modeling using a wide array of examples, including predictive modeling, an advanced treatment of regression, visualization and graphics, and automated analysis for high dimensional data. The second half will introduce students to applications in data science such as analytics of images and video as well as subjective data processing and analysis.
